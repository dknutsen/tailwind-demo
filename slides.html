# Functional CSS: Tailwind

## 2020/07/14

---

# What is functional CSS?

* Functional CSS is the concept of using tiny, single-purpose utility classes instead of writing custom CSS
--

* A number of Functional CSS Frameworks exist to provide extensible utility classes:

    * Tailwind
    * Tachyons
    * Basscss
    * etc.
--

* These are pretty comparable but we're going to focus on Tailwind...
--

* NOTE: Functional CSS is controversial. I'm not really trying to convert anyone, just provide a clear introduction and a fair overview of potential benefits
---

# Tailwind...

* "is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces"
--

* Is *not a UI kit*. It doesn't have a default theme, and there are no built-in UI components
--

* "Has no opinion about how your site should look and doesn't impose design decisions that you have to fight to undo"
--

* Provides highly composable, low-level utility classes that make it easy to build complex user interfaces
--

* Is responsive by default
--

* Is highly customizable
--


Let's see it in action...

# What does this make you think/feel?

```
<div class="max-w-sm rounded overflow-hidden shadow-lg">

  <img class="w-full" src="https://tailwindcss.com/img/card-top.jpg" alt="Sunset in the mountains">

  <div class="px-6 py-4">
    <div class="font-bold text-xl mb-2">The Coldest Sunset</div>
    <p class="text-grey-darker text-base">
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Voluptatibus quia, nulla! Maiores et perferendis eaque, exercitationem praesentium nihil.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="px-6 py-4">
    <span class="inline-block bg-grey-200 rounded-full px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold text-grey-700 mr-2">
      #photography

    <span class="inline-block bg-grey-200 rounded-full px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold text-grey-700 mr-2">

  </div>

</div>
```

# Common objections:

--

* "isn't this just inline CSS, which is evil?"
--

* "it makes the DOM ugly and hard to read"
--

* "you're coupling your styles too closely to your DOMG!!!"
--

* "won't I end up with like a million styles that I don't need that take up hella space?"
--

* "but what about semantic class names?"
--

* "there is way too much repetition"
--

* "oh great another css framework to have to learn in addition to bootstrap, foundation, semantic-ui, art19-ui etc."
--

* "this is an unmaintainable dumpster fire"
--

* "I don't like it. You're a bad man and your heart is dark"

# Demo time!

---

# "isn't this just inline CSS, which is evil?"

No, it is different from inline CSS in a number of significant ways.


Inline styles:

* don't respect media queries, which basically rules out responsive design
* aren't limited to pre-defined options (36 shades of orange)
* cause specificity issues, since they trump stylesheets
* don't support print-specific styles
* can't address pseudo-elements (such as ::before and ::after)
* aren't reusable
* are a pain to type (longer, uglier)

---

# "it makes the DOM ugly, hard to read"

This is probably the most legitimate objection

--

*however* I would argue that:

* this conveys a lot of information that traditional CSS does not
* there are multiple options for making things readable
    * components (ember or tailwind)
    * using multi-line tag/attribute definitions
    * other abstractions...
* you get used to it pretty quickly


---

# "you're coupling your styles too closely to the DOM!!!"

This is partially true, but keep a couple things in mind:

* CSS is already very tightly coupled to the DOM
* By removing a layer of abstraction you're saving a lot of (arguably unnecessary) work

---

# "won't I end up with like a million styles that I don't need?"

No.

- Tailwind allows you to customize exactly what gets generated
???
You can customize exactly what classes get generated, meaning it can be as small as you need it to be. Which is also great for constraining your styleguide and choices

--

- Even better: PurgeCSS
???
But even better, it's easy to wire up PurgeCSS which removes unused styles. Your tailwind config can be as large as you want with no ill effect

--

- Functional CSS tends to grow at a slow rate, and is essentially upper bounded
???
Because the upper bound is essentially the size of your tailwind config and you tend to reuse a lot of classes rather than adding new ones

---

# "but what about semantic class names?"

There is nothing stopping you from adding additional class names to your markup. There just won't be CSS attached to those class names.


---

# "there is way too much repetition"

Tailwind provides the `@apply` directive which you can use to extract "component classes" e.g.:
```
.btn-blue {
  @apply bg-blue text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded;
}
.btn-blue:hover {
  @apply bg-blue-dark;
}
```

--

**However** I would argue that Ember has an even better reusability construct: components!

* use components as your primary reusability mechanism
* use tailwind "component classes" sparingly.

---

# "oh great another css framework to have to learn in addition to bootstrap, foundation, semantic-ui, art19-ui etc."

Picking up Tailwind is much easier than most other UI frameworks for a few reasons:

* "it's not a UI kit" - you're not learning how to use someone else's components or design patterns
* If you know CSS you're already 90% of the way there
* In general the class names are intuitive and can be guessed and if not they are easily referenced
* Tailwind is very refined and smooths the rough edges of CSS with sensible resets and constraints
* Experimenting is easy and, dare I say, fun


---

# "this is an unmaintainable dumpster fire"

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èthis one is harder to argue one way or the other.

* EmberMap anecdote
???
The EmberMap gents insist that in their several years of working with Tailwind and Tachyons they have experienced no maintainability issues and in fact it is easier to maintain than traditional CSS, but that's mostly anecdotal...

--

* Our CSS
???
In our CSS we run into a lot of issues with complex hierarchies of styles and markup making it difficult to change markup without big CSS changes, and making CSS changes is hard because it could break other places or be duplicated. Essentially our CSS sometimes holds our code hostage.

# "I don't like it. You're a bad man and your heart is dark"

`#sorrynotsorry`

# Potential Benefits

* You don't have to write any CSS
--

* You don't have to do nearly as much naming (this is a lot of work)
--

* You can tell what something looks like by just reading the markup for it
--

* You don't ever have to worry that changing the styles for one thing will break something else
--

* You never have to deal with one instance of a thing needing a slightly different style than the other instances.
--

* Your CSS grows logarithmically rather than linearly or exponentially over time
--

* It's easy to un-apply a style by just removing the class (as opposed to the traditional cascade where you may have to override, adding even more CSS)
---

# Potential Benefits (2)

* You are constrained to a specific, recognizable set of sizes, colors, etc. out of the box
--

* You don't end up with "dead CSS"
--

* (unsubstantiated) Rendering performance is supposedly improved
--

* (purely anecdotal) It's fast for development and makes CSS fun again
---

# Ember + Tailwind

* Easy to get up and running with ember-cli-postcss
--

* Adding purgecss plugin keeps the generated CSS tiny
--

* Easy customization of tailwind config, addition of tailwind "components", and custom "traditional" CSS

---

# Notes and thoughts

* It may just not be for you, I personally love it but that doesn't mean you have to
--

* Like any tool, it's won't be right for every job
--

* You can set a prefix for migrating from traditional CSS to Tailwind (or for any other reason)
--

* I personally think the best (and only) way to decide what you think about it is to actually try it out
